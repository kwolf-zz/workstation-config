# Puppet Workstation Configuration Files. #

These configuration files are for my workstations.  Feel free to use
them as examples, but don't count on them working anywhere else.

##  Debian only  ##

These were developed on Kubuntu, and will probably mostly  work on Ubuntu
, and maybe even Debian with a bit of tweaking.
